This project implements a facial expression recognition system using PyTorch and a modified ResNet18 architecture. It trains on  grayscale facial images into emotion categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, and more using the FER2013 dataset.
Each subfolder should contain grayscale images belonging to that emotion class.
The code automatically reads the class labels based on folder names.
